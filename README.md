# Diabetes Prediction App

This is a machine learning web application that predicts diabetes risk based on key health metrics. It uses the best model selected from **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, and **XGBoost**, trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, and provides an interactive **Streamlit** interface.



## Project Overview

This project includes:
- Data preprocessing, scaling, and model training using scikit-learn and XGBoost
- Automatic selection and saving of the best model
- A Streamlit web app for real-time diabetes risk prediction
- User-friendly UI for entering health details



## Files Included

- `train_model.py`: Trains multiple models, selects the best, and saves the model and scaler.
- `app.py`: Streamlit web app that lets users enter data and get predictions.
- `diabetes_model.pkl`: Saved best model (generated by `train_model.py`).
- `diabetes_scaler.pkl`: Saved scaler for preprocessing (generated by `train_model.py`).
- `diabetes.csv`: Dataset used for training.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
